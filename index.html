					<h2>Darth Vader, film character, lead villain of the popular American science fiction franchise Star Wars. First seen in the movie Star Wars (1977; later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope), the towering, black-clad Darth Vader is a menacing villain.</h2>
					<p>Darth Vader, previously known as Anakin Skywalker, is the most well-known villain in the Star Wars franchise and perhaps in all movie history. From his intimidating appearance in his dark helmet, which is the only thing keeping him alive, to his horrifying ability to use the Force to kill with minimal effort, Vader is far from weak. Indeed, he is a force to be reckoned with and is not to be crossed. And yet, from the moment he saved his son from Darth Sidious, fans have believed he was something other than a villain. Does this act really redeem him or make him anything other than a Sith Lord? Known for his cruelty and lack of mercy on his adversaries and even his own men, Vader is cold and harsh on the outside, the complete opposite of Anakin Skywalker, whose compassion overrides that of any other Jedi. With this in mind, the question that arises is: is Darth Vader truly a villain? While many consider Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader to be two completely separate beings, they are the same at their core. Vader’s tyrannical brutality is top-tier, showing no mercy whatsoever. While many believe that his tragic origin story is what qualifies him as an anti-hero rather than a villain, Vader seems to walk the line between villain and anti-hero. </p>
